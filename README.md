# CS188
Repository to store material for BerkeleyX's CS188 course on Artificial Intelligence
(see https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-uc-berkeleyx-cs188-1x).

## Programming language

While the official language for this course is Python, I adapted the exercises
to use C++ instead.

## LICENSING

The original license that can be found at the beggining of each code sample provided
in the course is as follows:

```
# Licensing Information:  You are free to use or extend these projects for
# educational purposes provided that (1) you do not distribute or publish
# solutions, (2) you retain this notice, and (3) you provide clear
# attribution to UC Berkeley, including a link to http://ai.berkeley.edu.
#
# Attribution Information: The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley.
# The core projects and autograders were primarily created by John DeNero
# (denero@cs.berkeley.edu) and Dan Klein (klein@cs.berkeley.edu).
# Student side autograding was added by Brad Miller, Nick Hay, and
# Pieter Abbeel (pabbeel@cs.berkeley.edu).
```

My work on this course is published via github, which may seem to violate the
second point above. However, I do not believe my published work could stand as
a solution to the course exercises, as I use C++ instead of Python. Hence my
solution would fail the tests provided by UC Berkeley's autograder, which shows
the code samples stored here do not provide a valid solution.
